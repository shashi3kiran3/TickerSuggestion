Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) first launched the Model Y in 2020 and it became the world’s best-selling car in 2023. The ageing model lost some sales momentum last year, hurt by competition from local rivals in China such as Xiaomi (OTC: XIACF )’s YU7, while in other markets demand for electric vehicles has weakened. In January, Tesla launched a new version of the Model Y with a redesigned exterior and upgraded features in Asia Pacific markets and in July registered plans with Chinese authorities for the new Model Y L. A longer-range, rear-wheel drive Model 3 is also coming to the Chinese market, according to filing information published on China’s industry ministry website in July. Elon Musk’s Tesla registered an 8.4% fall in July sales of its China-made electric vehicles.
